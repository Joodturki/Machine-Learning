Dataset describtion:
The dataset contains information about houses, including some features such as arrea, number of bedrooms, bathrooms, and location. Each row represents a single house, and the target variable is the house price.
Machine Learning Problem:
The goal of this project is to predict the price of a house based on its features. This is a regression problem, where a machine learning model learns the relationship between input features (size, location, etc.) and the target variable (price).
