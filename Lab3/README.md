Dataset Features:

Area: Square footage of the house, which is generally one of the most important predictors of price.

Bedrooms & Bathrooms: The number of rooms in a house significantly affects its value. Homes with more rooms tend to be priced higher.

Floors: The number of floors in the house.

Year Built: The age of the house can affect its condition and value. Newly built houses are generally more expensive than older ones.

Location: Houses in desirable locations such as downtown or urban areas tend to be priced higher than those in suburban or rural areas.

Condition: The current condition of the house is critical, as well-maintained houses (in 'Excellent' or 'Good' condition) will attract higher prices compared to houses in 'Fair' or 'Poor' condition.

Garage: Availability of a garage can increase the price due to added convenience and space.

Price: The target variable, representing the sale price of the house.
